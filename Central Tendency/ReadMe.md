✔ Ungrouped data (with frequencies)  
✔ Raw data (without frequencies)

**Features:**  
- Smart auto-method selection for Mean
- Step-by-step solutions
- Clean tabular output (dynamically generated table)

*Note: No AI was used for coding — 100% manual coding.  

**Usage:**  
1. Run the program  
2. Choose an option (Mean/Median/Mode)  
3. Enter data & get results

Compile with any C compiler (e.g., `gcc`), OR any online compiler (e.g. Programiz).
