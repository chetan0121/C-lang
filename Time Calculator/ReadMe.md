-------< Time Calculator >-------

A C program that calculates the difference between two dates/times and displays the result in multiple formats (years, months, days, hours, minutes).  

# Key Features :-
- ✅ *Two Modes:*  
   - Normal : date only (days, months, years)  
   - Advanced : date+time (includes hours & minutes)  
- ⏱ Auto-Fill Option: Press any non-numeric key to use current date/time.
- 📅 Smart Year Handling: Supports 2-digit years (e.g., `24` → `2024`).  
- 🔍 Input Validation: Checks for valid dates, times, and logical ranges (e.g. 19/2/2001 is Invalid).  
- 📊 Flexible Output: Shows results in multiple units (e.g., "3 Years, 2 Months" or "1168 Hours").  


# *Example Output*
```
4 Years, 3 Months, 5 days and 3 Hours  
OR 51 Months, 5 Days, 3 Hours  
OR 1557 Days and 3 Hours  
OR 37371 Hours and 55 Minutes  
```  

Ideal for age calculators, project timelines, or any date/time difference needs!  
Note: Total days calculation follows business standard - end date is excluded.
